The 'broadlink' module must be installed in the python site-packages.
Example:
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install broadlink # or 'pip install -r requirements.txt'

The broadlink-cli is taken from the github repo of the python module.
At some future point, it will probably be part of the package but not yey.
